# raytracer1

A Scala implementation of the ray-tracer described at: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

I borrowed some Java code from https://github.com/yhcheer/RayTracingInOneWeekend which I intend to fully rewrite in Scala, as the succinctness of the code should enable it to better demonstrate how ray tracers work.


## Usage

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[dotty-example-project](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project/blob/master/README.md).
